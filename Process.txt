1. Get API from Binance
    Problem: don't want to connect with my actual Binance account which has actual BTC 
    Find a way to get a fake Binance API : Found Binance Test Net 
    https://docs.binance.org/guides/testnet.html
    a. Successfully added Binance Test net to my metamask
    b. Successfully got 1BNB credited into my test account 
    **Now how do I get an API?**
    c. Downloaded a VPN to circumvent the geolocation
    d. Now looking where I'm getting the API from 
    => learning about websockets/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2ePTq-KTzQ/https://pypi.org/project/websocket-client/
    **candlestick data are used to show how the market is moving, with open price, close price, highprice, low price**
    
    - using websocket instead of API?
    - Spot trading instead of futures : spot allows instant trades => will select spot trading for this project 

    https://testnet.binance.vision/

    => got my API_KEY and API_SECRET from Binance Spot testnet 
    => now looking at how to set that whole thing up 

    => Should I use CCXT library and forget about Websockets? 
    => Explore https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/ and see if it's worth adding it


2. Start defining which kinds of functions are going to be necessary
    as well as starting my boiler plate:
        - SmartBot.sol
        - deployBot.py
        - .env file with sensitive variables
        - helpful_scripts.py to get the account used for testing and other recurring functions
=> do I write a script for each connection ? Like one script to get exchange 1, one script for exchange 2, one script for flashloans
=> still struggle defining what goes into the .sol and what goes into .py files 
    => .sol interacts with the blockchain, that means it creates blocks, it deals with transactions
        => in that sense, SmartBot.sol's functions are used to trigger flashloan/buy/sell 
        => SmartBot.sol is also used to connect with other contracts that I'll need to use
    => does that mean that the python scripts are for?:
        => getting prices, checking if prices are different enough to trigger flashloans
        => connect to account
        =>
