1. Get API from Binance
    Problem: don't want to connect with my actual Binance account which has actual BTC 
    Find a way to get a fake Binance API : Found Binance Test Net 
    https://docs.binance.org/guides/testnet.html
    a. Successfully added Binance Test net to my metamask
    b. Successfully got 1BNB credited into my test account 
    **Now how do I get an API?**
    c. Downloaded a VPN to circumvent the geolocation
    d. Now looking where I'm getting the API from 
    => learning about websockets/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2ePTq-KTzQ/https://pypi.org/project/websocket-client/
    **candlestick data are used to show how the market is moving, with open price, close price, highprice, low price**
    
    - using websocket instead of API?
    - Spot trading instead of futures : spot allows instant trades => will select spot trading for this project

    => got my API_KEY and API_SECRET from Binance Spot testnet 
    => now looking at how to set that whole thing up
