# Project
First project on my own since following along tutorials:

My goal is to build an interface that will let a user borrow a certain Amount of Tokens through the Aave Protocol.

This borrowed amount won't need collateral as it will be a flashloan; the user should be able to chose between a list 
of options on what to do with that borrowed amount.

Because it's my first solo project, I'm going to keep it simple and only offer the user the choice to select between
a few exchanges and perform an arbitrage operation, select the token they want to use to compare the exchanges' selling
prices, and perform a buy and sell according to a pre-determined (by the user) difference (max and min value) of price
between each platform


Ideally, several platforms should be included, several tokens accepted (as long as the user has some of the specified
token already on the exchange selected - or not? ) 


# Versions

I've been stuck in some ways and tried to figure my way out of a problem by creating more, so for the sake of moving forward
with the project, I decided to utilize a template that works, destructure it to understand it fully, and modify it, implement my
logic around it.

# Logs

Many logs can be found on each version to inform on the process, research, state of the project.
