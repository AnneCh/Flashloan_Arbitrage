# Project

First project on my own since following along tutorials:

My goal is to build a website where people can use a mix of the arbitrage principle and flashloans in order to start their first investment with a very low initial investment (necessary fees to pay to use the program).

Because it's my first solo project, I'm going to keep it simple and only offer the user the choice to select between two exchanges, on which they will need to have an `account` and a certain `amount` of the `token` that they want to Arbitrage on.

Users will be able to select a token pair they want to compare on exchanges, get the selling prices, and perform a buy and sell according to a pre-determined strategy (need to define more in details what choices users can make -%?fourchette?how sophisticated can the strategy get? )

I want the users to be able to choose from a diversity of tokens, and in the future, from a diversity of exchanges as well.

# Versions

I was stuck in some ways and tried to figure my way out of a problem by creating more, so for the sake of moving forward with the project, I decided to utilize a template that works, destructure it to understand it fully, and modify it, implement my logic around it.

# Logs

I've decided to include the notes I'm taking as I move forward in coding this projects. Those notes can be found under the name of `logs` and can be found on each version to inform on the process, research, state of the project. On the latest version, one separate log was created per day of work, date can be read according to the american date type, MM/DD.
