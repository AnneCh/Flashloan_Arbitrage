# Project
First project on my own since following along tutorials:

My goal is to build a website where people can use a mix of the arbitrage principle and flashloans in order to start their first investment with a very low initial investment (necessary fees to pay to use the program).


Because it's my first solo project, I'm going to keep it simple and only offer the user the choice to select between a few exchanges, on which they will need to have an `account` and a certain ${amount} of the ${selected token} that they want to Arbitrage on. 

Users will be able to select the token they want to use to compare the ${selected exchanges}' selling prices, and perform a buy and sell according to a pre-determined (by the user) ${difference} (max and min value) of price between each ${exchange}.


Ideally, several platforms should be included, several tokens accepted 


# Versions

I was stuck in some ways and tried to figure my way out of a problem by creating more, so for the sake of moving forward with the project, I decided to utilize a template that works, destructure it to understand it fully, and modify it, implement my logic around it.

# Logs

Many logs can be found on each version to inform on the process, research, state of the project.
