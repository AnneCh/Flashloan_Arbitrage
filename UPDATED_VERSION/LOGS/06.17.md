Today I've mostly done research and fell down the rabbit hole.... One of the videos I watched from Julien from Eat The Blocks was about different kinds of flashloan providers.
He was exposing the differences between Aave, Uniswap and DyDx.
I've learned a few things that may have me review my choice of provider.

Basically, the main differences go as follow:

- DyDx does not charge fees for their flashloans, and the flashloaned amount can be traded directly on DyDx, but their currency selection is poor and their integration uneasy
- Aave is only 0.09% and the currency list is long; but using the flashloaned money on Aave isn't possible
- Uniswap allows use of the flashloaned assets on the platform and the list of currencies is long; but the fee for a flahsloan is 0.3% of the flashloaned amount

In any decision, there are concessions to be made. The points on which to concede are the following:

- Fee
- Diversity of assets
- Ease of integration

Here is what I think

- the market is volatile and immature. We've seen a lot of projects popping up and dying, there were a lot of error404 and a lot of tokens bought. The decentralized market will keep evolvind until solid, fundational protocols emerge (or keep growing) and unify things. In this kind of market, diversity is, I think, very important, so I want my project to offer a diversity of assets for people to flashloan and make profit of.
  +1 for diversity

- Fees will definitely deter some investors to use my project, if they are too high. Going for a platform promoting low/no fees is attractive, but not transaction of this kind is available free of fees. It's a matter of mitigating the fees against the potential profit. I think most serious investors will make sure the fees are covered and much more before setting up their strategy. Fees are important, but that won't be my first priority

- Ease of integration is important for me, I do want to be challenged, for sure, but I also do not want to spend more time than necessary to have something functional. I can always modify it later or make another version of it with harder integration processes. Also, if I can use the flashloaned assets directly on the uniswap platform, on top of reducing the number of lines of code, it may also reduce the overal fees
  +1 for integration

It looks like I'm likely going more toward an integration with Uniswap with arbitrage between Uniswap and Sushiswap.

I'll dig deeper and keep watching the series on flashloans

++ new information, rethink strategy

- I should have found that information earlier when researching about flashloan function, I went with what I was familiar with (Aave recommended and used in tutorial video), instead of looking for the best option available

-+ I also need to work on scripts and testing, like, really really.

- need to figure out the best approach, do I do Aave + uniswap/sushiswap, or only uniswap/sushiswap...

* Aave flashloan fee (0.09%) or Uniswap flashloan fee (0.3%)
* Uniswap and SushiSwap trade fee (0.3% on each)
* Ethereum transaction fee .
* Slippage on the Uniswap market and slippage on the SushiSwap market

INTERESSANT : https://api.cryptorank.io/docs#section/
The other thing that I need to really understand, is which part of the arbitrage code is to be done in solidity (whichever part interacts with a smart contract, I would assume, and only that) and which ones can be done in scripts

DID:

- correct helpful_scripts for the get_account(), added the SPDX license
- figured out why the script was not running (`brownie run scripts/helpful_scripts --network kovan`), source .end wasn't workimg cause I wasn't in the correct directory
- ran `source .env` and the script
  => compiling isn't working mostly because `_asset` seems to be posing problem. Also the SPDX licenses to see.
