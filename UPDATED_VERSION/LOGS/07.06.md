Today I've been taught about Crypto Wizards, a platform of tools made to render flashloans more accessible (Thanks Warren!)

In one of hid vieos, Shaun from CW talks about tenderly, a platform recommended by one of his followers, that helps traceback errors and reversions.

I've run the last transaction hashes through it, and the reason why my flashloan fails seems to be because I don't have enough WETH on my contract.
whish still seems weird to me, as the contract has 0.4WETH on it.
So except if I decide to go for another solution, I'll be following the plan I had : fix the witdraw function, and gather 1ETH to try Patricks' code unchanged.
