Today I've been taught about Crypto Wizards, a platform of tools made to render flashloans more accessible (Thanks Warren!)

In one of hid vieos, Shaun from CW talks about tenderly, a platform recommended by one of his followers, that helps traceback errors and reversions.

I've run the last transaction hashes through it, and the reason why my flashloan fails seems to be because I don't have enough WETH on my contract.
whish still seems weird to me, as the contract has 0.4WETH on it.
So except if I decide to go for another solution, I'll be following the plan I had : try and fix the withdraw function, and gather 1ETH to try Patricks' code unchanged. And see from there.

# A few hours later...

I've redeployed several contracts, modified the withdraw function to include a funding of the contract, then realized that I could still try to withdraw even with 0 funds, as long as I can reach a reverted transaction for lack of funds on the contract.

Some wrote that Kovan may be the issue. I've tried by changing the network to a mainnet-fork thru ganache-cli, result is the same

I've tried modifying the withdraw function in the contract code itself, not working either.

I suspect the problem may be coming from the withdraw script, several times I've read it may have to do with some authorization that metamask isn't explicitely giving or something like that. But I have not seen this being brought up in the tutorial...

I will keep digging
