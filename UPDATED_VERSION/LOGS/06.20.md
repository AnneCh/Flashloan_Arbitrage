I'll focus on understanding the logic I need to implement in order to track the app's users' addresses and use mappings correctly.
I need to find out the length of the array of users, turn it into a uint256 which will be used to add to the mapping of Users
it may look something like this:

`for(i=0; i < Users[].length, i++){ indexUsers = i + 1; userIndex[msg.sender] = indexUsers; return indexUsers(address(this)); }`

The more I think about how to code my ideas, the more confused I get about how to differentiate the callers. There's the external caller, the one who calls my contract and flashloan function, and then there's my contract, who calls the functions from the Aave protocol (and then Uniswap and Sushiswap).
is `msg.sender` 's scope limited to a transaction, or to the entire contract?

Alright, I have my answer.
If I want to track the user, aka the one who called the contract initially, I need to set their address to tx.origin, as they will be the one paying the first fee to interact with the contract.

Then, when my contract calls Aave's, msg.sender will be my contract's address.
Got it.
