I have a better understanding now of what the smart contracts are doing
My biggest issue is that I am not yet comfortables writting scripts.
This is what I need to focus on:

- list the scripts that need to be made
  => tests, refresh on plugin that useful (jest?)
  => write unit tests: how many functions do I need to test? Start with scripts to test the smart contract functions
  => figure out the scripts that need to be written to trigger the arbitrage (stay on python or switch to js?)
  => refresh memory and go through links and resources that I already have gathered (arbritrage mostly)

Then I'll focus on the aesthetics and user friendliness, but it's not my priority (workin on ReactJS with portfolio built)

1. Unit tests

Flashloan logic

- test if we can borrow 1ETH
- test with an address that's not the owner
- test to withdraw with borrowers' address, and with another address
- test to withdraw more than what there is

2. Scripts

- init
- helpful scripts : connect wallet, check network connection, mocks
- implementing mocks, even if non-necessary, would be ideal for me to review how to implement and use them (haven't worked on it in months)
