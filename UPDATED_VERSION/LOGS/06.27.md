I've noticed that my Infura requests volume went through the roof over the weekend, I received emails stating that I had used 75% of my allocated volume, then the next day it was 100%. The weird part is that I received those emails the days I wasn't actively working on the project.
Either transactions take time to be updated on the Infura server, or there's something that I am not aware of.

I've deployed the contract once more, it went fine. Tried to fund my contract with WETH but I do not have enough ETH in my wallet. I've already used the faucets and still, it isn't enough. and Aave does not use rinkeby. I can't believe I'd get stuck on testing my scripts just because of that, there must be a workaround.
