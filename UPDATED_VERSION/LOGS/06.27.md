I've noticed that my Infura requests volume went through the roof over the weekend, I received emails stating that I had used 75% of my allocated volume, then the next day it was 100%. The weird part is that I received those emails the days I wasn't actively working on the project.
Either transactions take time to be updated on the Infura server, or there's something that I am not aware of.

I've deployed the contract once more, it went fine. Tried to fund my contract with WETH but I do not have enough ETH in my wallet. I've already used the faucets and still, it isn't enough. and Aave does not use rinkeby. I can't believe I'd get stuck on testing my scripts just because of that, there must be a workaround.
I tried reducing the MINIMUM_FLASHLOAN_WETH_BALANCE but it obviously failed. I got some WETH, but this WETH wasn't enough to cover the tx fees of calling the flashloan contract
https://faucets.chain.link/ this link gives enough ETH for me to try, also only once/24h.

I've tried several times, I have changed the amounts of minimum balance, I'm wondering if there's not a problem with the way the script grabs my account... cause I have enough WETH available to cover the 0.02ETH necessary... or am I f\*\*\* up again on the math?

I tried deleting my build folder + package-lock.json, recompile and run the scripts, but the same error went through.

I can't figure out what is going on, and needed a break, so I wrote my first test to check if my account was the correct account being grabbed with the get_account().
Test passed!
