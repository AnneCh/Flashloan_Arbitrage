Even though my code is correct, the MIT licenses are correct and every contract is under the compiler 0.6.6, but the compiler keeps throwing the error.
I believe there may be a sourcing problem, as I've located my working directory on my external hard drive, and brownie and the associated OpenZeppeling packages creating issues seem to be located on the computer.

The build folder created has only empty folders, and the contracts that the compilers lists as being without SPDX license identifier, all have one (MIT)

I will try removing all brownie config files from my computer, delete all files related to this project from my computer, only keep a backup on the external drive, and clone from github the folder I'll be working from, onto my computer.
