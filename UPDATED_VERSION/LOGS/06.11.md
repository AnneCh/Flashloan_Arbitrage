I started by reading my code again, trying to strip it from anything that I don't understand or anything redundant.

I spent some time thinking about the logic of my DApp, writting the actions I want it to perform.
I tried to link those actions to functions and arrays and variables, keeping in mind the naming conventions and unitary aspect of each object or function that I am building.

I added mappings to track the users and their flashloaned assets/amounts :

- usersIndex maps individual users' address to a uint256
- singleUserIndex maps users' address to the asset and amount of asset flashloaned

I added a condition in the userFlashloan function, to check if the user's address is already part of the mapping, and if not, to add the address to the mapping
