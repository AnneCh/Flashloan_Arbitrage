# Brainstorm

I want this bot to be simple, to offer few options so to be suitable for people who have no idea
how to trade, how to build a trading strategy, so they can just click a few buttons and have
their bot start working for them.

--- WHAT THE BOT NEEDS TO DO

- needs to listen to two(or more) markets, get prices for a selected currencies/assets, and execute trades

- needs to be cloud based so the bot doesn't stop when shutting the computer

Ensure that before I start coding, I have:

- Registered and been approved to use an exchange (Binance ok)
- Enabled API usage on the exchange and have an API key (Binance ok)
- Decided how I will be hosting my bot (not done that yet...)

---

--- FRONT END

- Connect Users {Metamask} Wallet to the bot
- Disconnect Users Wallet from the bot
  Once connected

  - Select m a/several \${tokens} to Arbitrage()
  - Selecte 2/more \${exchanges} to Arbitrage() on
  - Select a ${minAmount} and ${maxAmount} to flashloan as the \${amountToArbitrage}
  - Save their selection as template
  - Save their selection as StrategyName in the Strategies
  - Upload their StrategyName to our Bot (_cool animation_) and give our Bot on the mission to find the selection that the User has chosen.

  == In order to perform a flashloan, the user must meet certain criteria

  - Once the Bot has accepted (_quick review of the points before and checking that everything is fine_) the StrategyName, the User can either see data, or choose for the Bot to stop executing their StrategyName

  - Users can have up to 2 Strategies for free, for more strategies, Users need to upgrade their Account by depositing some Coins(Tokens, cryptocurrencies like ETH or BTC, preferred currency will have to be determined).

--- DEFINE LOGIC

Every X seconds :

- Analyze 2 (or more?) platforms (API Calls?) => example, Is there more than a 2% difference on the price of BTC between platform X and platform Y ? => IF YES1, trigger a flashloan contract => place the Buy Order on platform X => Get latest price on platform Y => is price still at or above 2% higher than what I just bought? => IF YES2, Sell => Withdraw => trigger contract to payback the flashloan / IF NO2 => Cancel trade

=> IF NO1, do nothing

### (keep in mind to keep the code simple and as direct as possible, I'll have to skim my code for ways to shorten while still being as secure as possible)

// _Strategies_:

- Up to 2 for free

  Each Strategy is composed of different fields to be filled in by the Users

  - Display Coins available to trade by fetching the Users' Metamask's Wallet Balance of Coins
    (Users can only trade)
    ====>>>> Option to access a platform to buy coins (ideally exchanges that we have listed )
  - Selection of one (or several??) Coins to Arbitrage()
  - Selection of amount of Coins to FlashLoan()

USEFUL DATA

- withdrawal fees for ERC20 tokens tend to be very high
- make sur about the withdrawal limits/KYC for the exchange platforms chosen
- OpenOcean
- pick up a server that allows me to run my bot 24/7 (Digital Ocean, AWS, Azure, CGS)

IF FLASHLOANS : Can I connect to a platform like DEFI PULSE get the best price for flashloans?
Or is it better to just get into Aave or Compound

Flashloan logic through Aave:

- Contract.sol calls the `LendingPool` contract, requesting a flash loan of a certain `amounts` of `reserves` using `flashloans()`
- await for the `LendingPool` to transfer the requested `amounts` of the `reserves` to my contract, then calls `executeOperation()` on my contract (or whatver contract I specify as being the `_receiver`)
- Now that my contract has the holding flash loaned `mounts`, I need to execute the code that will buy from an exchange and sell onto another one
  => if the buy/sell has worked properly, aka, if I made profit, then I transfer the flash loaned `amounts` of `reserves` back to the `LendingPool`
  => the `LendingPool` contract updates the relevant details of the reserves and pulls the flash loaned amount + fee
  => if the `amount` owed is not available (due to a lack of balance or approval) then the transaction reverts

What I need:
=> addresses, abi and fee information for each exchange
=> all token assets that I want to monitor, and their configuration
=> amount of money to risk for each trade

Smart contract used to buy one token on one exchange and sell the same token ona different exchange.
With a smart contract, only if both transactions are successfull is the strategy executed

#24.02.22

Import of the Aave V2 protocol, to use the flashloan services.

- reused Patrick's code for importing
- reused my brownie-config file, modified default network and OpenZeppelin contract version
- created a get_weth.py script, will try do write by myself but not sure if I can do that without looking at anybody's code yet

==> Managed to import what is necessary (I think but will look deeper later), and compiling worked!

#26.02.22

---- not everything had been compiled, now I'm facing issues between the imported versions. I am struggling to look up the answer, every search I start leads to something very different than what I am looking for.
I keep on digging, maybe I'll leave the node_modules folder out for now and keep working on the code itself to move forward, but at the same time it seems like something I should be able to fix as a beginner, something that will be considered a very basic move in the future.

Ok, so, I've revised my position 1) I had decided to go through with Aave V2 flashloans, not finding information on whether there should be some kind of mix between V3 and V2 given that V3 doesn't have a tutorial for flashloans yet and keeps sending us back to V2 2) Remembered there is a brownie mix for flashloans, the one that Patrick used in his tutorial

    I decided to download the mix and work on it, as my research keeps dragging in time and I don't reach a place where I can finally start working on scripts and the logic inside the flashloan
    I'll take the time to go through each document and make sure I understand what's going on at a core level, use the mix as a ground to evaluate my understanding and ease to implement smart contracts.

    => mix downloaded, get_weth script run with only the issue that I didn't have enough test ETH, so I got some, but still couldn't reach 1 ETH to trade to 1 WETH to be able to interact with the lending pool (as it only accepts wrapped ETH)
    I ended up changing the logic to only give me 0.000001 WETH, time to stack up test ETH.
    -Although I will also have to run tests on Ganache, so I could use the unlimited Ganache test ETH supply to buy WETH and test my logic.

    the integrated deployment_v2.py also got ran on kovan successfully

    ---- I've taken the time to deconstruct the Smart Contract that will be the interface between my Bot's users and the Ethereum Blockchain.
        --- Drawn a mapping and it's getting clearer the logic that is applied to build the functions, which functions are chosen and why

        - The constructor makes sure we set the LENDING_POOL as the address providing the flashloan

        - A function, executeOperation(), is the one that the LENDINGPOOL will call when our contract calls LENDING POOL to borrow
            It takes 5 parameters, and ensures that the LENDING_POOL address provider is allowed
            to withdraw our WETH + premium fees for using its loaning services
            It's basically the function that closes the Flashloan

        - Then, we have the function that will interact with the Lending Pool to actually get our flashloan, which is the one that our smart contract calls when the user wants to Borrow
        some Asset for some Amount, _flashloan()

        - Then, we have the function that will allow us to interact with the user (or is it really what it is? Why can't we do that in a script, as it doesn't interact directly with the blockchain? it does look like its requesting currency though, so lets see tomorrow when I work on it again)
