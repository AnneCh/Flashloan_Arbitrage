Even though my code is correct, the MIT licenses are correct and every contract is under the compiler 0.6.6, but the compiler keeps throwing the error.
I believe there may be a sourcing problem, as I've located my working directory on my external hard drive, and brownie and the associated OpenZeppeling packages creating issues seem to be located on the computer.

The build folder created has only empty folders, and the contracts that the compilers lists as being without SPDX license identifier, all have one (MIT)

I will try removing all brownie config files from my computer, delete all files related to this project from my computer, only keep a backup on the external drive, and clone from github the folder I'll be working from, onto my computer.

Ok, so I did just that, and it didn't change the problem.

I cloned Patrick's original flashloan with aave github repo, compiled, it worked. I replaced his contract with mine, and at compiling, the exact same error message `Warning: SPDX license identifier not provided in source file. Before publishing, consider adding a comment containing "SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX-License>" to each source file. Use "SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED" for non-open-source code. Please see https://spdx.org for more information.` came through.

Now I know the problem comes from the code inside my Flashloan_logic.
