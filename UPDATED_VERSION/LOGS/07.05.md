So far, my post on stackexchanged has not been answered, so I need to move forward and do other things.

As I mentioned last time, I'll focus on writing the proper withdrawal function and revising all the scripts and smart contract lines, compilers and all.

If I can get to 1ETH on kovan, I'll use it to clone Patrick's repo and run the flashloan function, see if the transaction reverts too.

If it reverts, then I'll seek a different approach. I could pick DyDx or just Uniswap, so to integrate the transaction without changing platform.
I'll see when I get there, but I gotta move forward with this project.

= got to 0.8ETH, tomorrow I should have enough to test Patricks' code

# Withdrawal function

in absolute, I want to automate a withdrawal function so that my contract does not keep funds on it for too long, puts the responsibility on the user.
In a withdrawal function, the transfer call will need to be preceded by a variable containing the tracking record of the withdrawals/contract's balance (mapping most probably)

but for now, I want a simple function so I can get my WETH back and not be stuck for lack of test funds
