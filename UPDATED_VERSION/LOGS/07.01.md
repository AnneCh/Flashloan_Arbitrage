I really do not understand what's going on, my contract now has 1WETH, I'm trying to borrow 1ETH and repay it instantaneously and it's still reverting !

I'll be building the function and script to withdraw the balance of the contract as I'd like to get my WETH back so I can try again.

LOOL I think I failed into the most basic trap of writing and deploying half-done smart contracts...
I deployed it without including a withdraw function in it. Now my test WETH is lost forever, locked in that contract. :D :D :D :D
Well, c'est en forgeant qu'on devient forgeron.
