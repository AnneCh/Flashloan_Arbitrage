I really do not understand what's going on, my contract now has 1WETH, I'm trying to borrow 1ETH and repay it instantaneously and it's still reverting !

I'll be building the function and script to withdraw the balance of the contract as I'd like to get my WETH back so I can try again.

LOOL I think I failed into the most basic trap of writing and deploying half-done smart contracts...
I deployed it without including a withdraw function in it. Now my test WETH is lost forever, locked in that contract. :D :D :D :D
Well, c'est en forgeant qu'on devient forgeron.

I'm mad at myself, cause I'll have to wait a few more days before gathering enough WETH to test again.
But that will give me enough time to review what I could be changing on my contract and modify my scripts to add more functions to test.

- check thoroughly the syntax of the withdraw function, the script will go like 1) get contract 2) get account 3) call withdraw method 4) print stuff

- modify the index and write scripts to add the users in indexes so we can keep track of who uses the platform
  gotta see if those indexes need to be in the smart contract or offchain
