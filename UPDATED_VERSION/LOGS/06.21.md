I'm going back to Patrick's simple storage with brownie to review the basics of deployment ann initialisation

okaaay so I figured why when I try to run a script, it wasn't working.

1. I forgot the `export` at the beginning of my .env lines
2. I wasn't always in the right folder
3. I had to run `source .env`
4. I add to add `dotenv : .env` in my brownie-config.yaml

I fixed the issue of terminal error `Python-dotenv could not parse statement starting at line 1` (x4) by removing the "" around my .env values.

When I try to deploy

````def deploy_flashloan():
    account = accounts[0]
    print(account)```
ganache-cli gets stuck and does not return anything:

```brownie run scripts/deploy.py
Brownie v1.17.2 - Python development framework for Ethereum

UpdatedVersionProject is the active project.

Launching 'ganache-cli --port 8545 --gasLimit 12000000 --accounts 10 --hardfork istanbul --mnemonic brownie --fork https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/27f654aa13854abda9b50ac627cbda36 --chainId 1'..
```
````

I've added my own network by entering my private key (from metamask wallet used for tests), requested for my account's address to be printed to the terminal, and the result was only sucessful through using Kovan. ganache-cli keeps spinning and not resolving
