I'm going back to Patrick's simple storage with brownie to review the basics of deployment ann initialisation

okaaay so I figured why when I try to run a script, it wasn't working.

1. I forgot the `export` at the beginning of my .env lines
2. I wasn't always in the right folder
3. I had to run `source .env`
4. I add to add `dotenv : .env` in my brownie-config.yaml

I fixed the issue of terminal error `Python-dotenv could not parse statement starting at line 1` (x4) by removing the "" around my .env values.
