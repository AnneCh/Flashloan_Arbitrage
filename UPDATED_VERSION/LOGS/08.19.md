Beginning of July, I was contacted by a man who's also learning web3 dev; he was interested in DeFi project building and was interested in my project, and wanted to see if we could help each other build our portfolios by building apps together.

It sounded fun, and I was starting to reach a stage where sharing ideas in a group, working with other brains on one project would be more stimulating than at first, when it sounded more daunting than anything because I wasn't familiar enough with the topic.

We discussed and he quickly confirmed what I had feared for a while, which is that I was working on a project much bigger than I could chew.
We decided to start working together on a smaller-scale, maybe easier project to make real, and settled for an NFT project.

I still have this DeFi app running in the back of my mind, but I think I'll gain more solid skills by creating smaller projects first, and going back to dealing with financial app later on. The good thing is, not working on this project also allows my brain to think deeper on how to render this app, both on the front and back-end.
