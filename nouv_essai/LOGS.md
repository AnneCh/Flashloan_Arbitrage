24.02.22

Import of the Aave V2 protocol, to use the flashloan services.
- reused Patrick's code for importing
- reused my brownie-config file, modified default network and OpenZeppelin contract version
- created a get_weth.py script, will try do write by myself but not sure if I can do that without looking at anybody's code yet 

==> Managed to import what is necessary (I think but will look deeper later), and compiling worked!

---- not everything had been compiled, now I'm facing issues between the imported versions. I am struggling to look up the answer, every search I start leads to something very different than what I am looking for. 
I keep on digging, maybe I'll leave the node_modules folder out for now and keep working on the code itself to move forward, but at the same time it seems like something I should be able to fix as a beginner, something that will be considered a very basic move in the future.
