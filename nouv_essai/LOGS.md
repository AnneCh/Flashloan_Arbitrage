Import of the Aave V2 protocol, to use the flashloan services.
- reused Patrick's code for importing
- reused my brownie-config file, modified default network and OpenZeppelin contract version
- created a get_weth.py script, will try do write by myself but not sure if I can do that without looking at anybody's code yet 

==> Managed to import what is necessary (I think but will look deeper later), and compiling worked!
