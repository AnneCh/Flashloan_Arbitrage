Ok, so there's clearly a bigger compiler compatibility issue than I thought.
Every time I try to compile, the error coming back is about compiling versions.
It seems like all of the solidity code from Aave is compiled with 0.8.10
but some of the Aave's libraries or dependencies are on a lower version 

I have to look up what's the usual protocol about compilers, as I feel it's been just under-explained,
I don't really know why to choose this or that compiler and how contracts with different compilers interact with one another

I've done some research, but I've fallen into the rabbit hole of information, reading about compilers, sure, but about security
mostly and best practices.

back to figuring out what the compiling issue is about 
https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/92265/solidity-proper-way-to-import-contracts
super interesting, finally understand the difference between the different ways of using importing contracts

I'm going to try something different.
Witht the little bit of code that I have now, I have tons of related dependencies and extra contracts that I
don't think I need to keep around.
I'm re-initiating a brownie mix in a separate folder and copy the relevant files.
