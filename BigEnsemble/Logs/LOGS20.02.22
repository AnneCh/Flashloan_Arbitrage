back to figuring out the differences in imports, between just import, 
import from, inheritance, libraries etc.. it's all a bit confusing as
it looks like in the end, we are getting very similar results,
either whatever that function returned, or the logic of the function to
return something depending on the input

=> It is better to import specific data/functions to not pollute the namespace (?)
for example
``` import * as symbolName from "filename";
 ```
 or``` import "filename" as symbolName;```
