No commercial bullshit day today, I have projects to work on. 
I need to figure out how to get my WETH with the code that I have.
I've followed two different ways of doing to try to get to that first step, the Aave
white paper on flashloans V2 (wanted to do V3 but the steps haven't been layed out yet,
had to follow V2), and the Aave flashloan tutuorial made by Patrick Collins.
I've written a script to exchange my ETH to WETH through the Kovan test network, which
I do have configured and I have some ETH and already have the WETH token registered. I
have entered my wallet ID and private key to have access to my testnet funds, but
the transaction does not go through.
